# Introduction

Did you always want to have your very own Discord bot, but was intimidated by the amount of knowledge you'd have to possess to be able to achieve that?

Or maybe you do have the necessary knowledge, but having to set the initial boilerplate discourages you?

Fret not! `Arcybot` is here to save your day, time and sanity!

`Arcybot` is a TypeScript library giving you a basic skeleton of a Discord bot. Don't waste your time setting the framework for a bot only to have to refactor it dozen of times later - `Arcybot` provides all that, and the only think you need is a simple config and a list of commands.

- TypeScript support
- support for [slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ)
